Heparin Infusion Adjustment Calculator for ECMO
This is a web-based tool designed to assist healthcare professionals, particularly nurses managing Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) cases, in titrating unfractionated heparin infusions. It provides guidance based on generalized nomograms for both aPTT and ACT values.

Purpose
Managing heparin anticoagulation in critically ill patients, especially those on ECMO, is complex and crucial for preventing both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. This application aims to provide quick, accessible guidance for adjusting heparin infusion rates, integrating common nomogram principles and important clinical considerations.

Features
Dual Nomogram Support: Users can select between an aPTT-based (Rashke-like) nomogram and an ACT-based nomogram, offering flexibility for different clinical practices and patient requirements, particularly in ECMO.
Automated Adjustment Calculation: Calculates recommended heparin adjustments (increase, decrease, hold, or no change) based on the input lab values (aPTT or ACT), current heparin infusion rate, and patient weight.
Contextual Guidance: Provides informative messages, including rationale for adjustments, suggested next lab check times, and cross-monitoring considerations (e.g., if using aPTT nomogram, it will comment on the entered ACT value).
Embedded Guidelines: Includes a collapsible section detailing important guidelines for heparin management in ECMO, referencing ELSO (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) general ACT targets and general aPTT therapeutic ranges.
Input Validation: Prevents negative numerical inputs, prompting users to recheck values for accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with HTML and styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design that works well across various devices, including mobile.
Clear Disclaimers: Contains explicit disclaimers emphasizing that the tool is for informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical judgment or institutional protocols.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure of the web application.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
JavaScript: Powers the nomogram logic, calculations, and interactive elements.
